# Daily DSA Practice

## 📌 Goal
- Solve at least **one DSA problem every day**
- Organize problems by topic as I go
- Each file will contain:
  - The problem
  - My approach and notes
  - Any useful tips or patterns

## 🗂️ Structure
- Topic folders like `arrays/`, `linked_lists/`, `trees/`
- Inside each folder:
  - `problem-name.ext` (e.g., `two_sum.java`)
  - Optional: `notes.md` if topic-specific notes grow large

## ✅ Commitment
Daily commit with one new problem solved and pushed to version control.
